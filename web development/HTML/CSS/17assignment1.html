       <p>
        I met a traveller from an antique land,<br/>
        who said-"two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br/> 
        stand in the desert .... near them on the sand,<br/>
        half sunk a shattered visage lies whose from<br/>
        and wrinkled lip,and sneer of cold command<br/>
        tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br/>
        which yet survive,stamped on these lifeless things<br/>
        the hand that mocked them and the heart that fed; <br/>
        and on the pedestal these words appers:<br/>
        my name is <span>ozmandias</span>, king of kings ;<br/>
        look on my works ye mightly and depairs!<br/>
        nothings besides remains round the decay<br/>
        of that colossal wreck boundless and bare<br/>
        the lone and level sands stretch far away.<br/>
       </p>
